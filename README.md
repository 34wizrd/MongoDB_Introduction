# MongoDB_Introduction

- Create your own branch
- Run the practice_mongodb.ipynb with jupyter-notebook or google colab or any software that read .ipynb file
- Create a project with some constraints listed in the python notebook file
- Connect your cloud database to mongodb compass and import the restaurants.json to your database
- Each of the exercises has 2 cells:
    + Write your query in pymongo and run in the FIRST cell
    + Don't run the SECOND cell because it contains the results for you to compare with your results
- Ask me any question if you have difficulties
- Good luck and use MongoDB
